A volatile, openly misogynist, racist figure rode to victory on a wave of his own creation. He skillfully manipulated voters with the aid of a fractured news system where fact became secondary to feeling and perception. In this world, resentment of immigrants, longing for the “America of the past,” and unfiltered racism were allowed to emerge from the shadows of the cornfields.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, here we are. We have on our (normal sized hands) a president who simply has no idea how to run a country, much less one as complex and obviously divided as America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things will get worse before they get better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Access to healthcare for 20 million Americans may be threatened by the proposed repeal of the ACA. Immigrants and economic and political refugees may face rejection at our borders, the very ones that welcomed our ancestors. Millions more who are struggling here to support their families abroad could face deportation, ripping families apart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps most troubling of all is the culture that our children will be raised in. Millions of young Americans will spend their first years of consciousness under a president without honor or decency, who does not show respect for their existence, who shows no sign that he believes in them as equals under God and under the laws of this land. And on top of that, they will know that millions and millions of Americans welcomed the man and his discrimination with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Waking up this morning, I’m struck with a new sense of urgency. A renewed call to action. We have work to do. We know what America can be. We need to break down the walls that isolate us. We need to work to restore facts and policies as the basis for choosing candidates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/an-american-tragedy-donald-trump?mbid=social_twitter&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt; The New Yorker editor-in-chief David Remnick’s words&lt;/a&gt; resonate with me this morning:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“. . . despair is no answer. To combat authoritarianism, to call out lies, to struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of American ideals—that is what is left to do. That is all there is to do.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need to struggle. And we must also be better to one another. How do I be better and combat this rampant othering, as a therapist, as a husband, as an American?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, I’m finding that the scripture comes up with another win. 1 Peter, 4:10 (NIV) says,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We must go forward and serve one another with a new virility, passion. We need to live that grace. We need to be better to each other. The work begins now.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>&quot;And thus, here we are. We have on our (normal sized hands) a president who simply has no idea how to run a country, much less one as complex and obviously divided as America. Things will get worse before they get better.&quot;</summary></entry><entry><title>A Therapist for Hillary</title><link href="/A_Therapist_for_Hillary/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A Therapist for Hillary" /><published>2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-11-03T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/A_Therapist_for_Hillary</id><content type="html" xml:base="/A_Therapist_for_Hillary/">&lt;p&gt;When I decided to write this blog, my goal was to focus my writing on subjects tied to mental health and my experiences in therapy. Key to my success would be to avoid writing about politics, but there are only 5 days until the election, people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider this a momentary relapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In evaluating the two major presidential candidates from a therapist’s perspective, the choice is clear. Hillary Clinton must be our next president. Using the core ethical values of our field as a litmus test, veracity, equality, beneficence, non-maleficence, it’s entirely clear that Donald Trump is about as far as one can be from demonstrating those principles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mere mention of a Trump presidency in one of my classes elicits visible shudders from professors and students alike. As therapists, it’s astounding to witness a nominee for president whose moral character runs so counter to our standards of being a decent person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure that there are some therapists who have become so jaded that they are now capable of doing the mental gymnastics necessary to support Donald Trump. But I have a hard time believing that they also approach therapy from a place of unconditional acceptance and celebration of the human condition. To espouse both the values inherent in therapy, and those of Donald Trump, even in different settings, would break a person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if one were to entirely ignore the ever-growing list of transgressions of Donald Trump and evaluate him based on what he calls his “policy proposals” alone, it’s clear that he is a man with little perception of reality, particularly when it comes to health care &amp;amp; mental health.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being the 7th grade-level thinker he is, Donald Trump issued a “paper” on healthcare. Released back in March, and just 1085 words long, no-one was surprised to discover that the document consisted entirely of his signature blend of complaints and sweeping, grandiose promises.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All but an afterthought, only one paragraph toward the end focuses on mental health. It states:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Finally, we need to reform our mental health programs and institutions in this country.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hooray. Someone on the Trump campaign recognized that combining the words “mental health” and “reform” works well with focus groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;“Families, without the ability to get the information needed to help those who are ailing, are too often not given the tools to help their loved ones.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay… So the country’s mental health crisis can be solved by just disseminating information to the families of those who suffer from mental health problems? Should be an easy fix! Clearly, this is someone with in-depth knowledge of the public mental health crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And it’s a good thing that the (quality) campaign staffer tasked with writing this mammoth document follows up with such well-thought out details on how we’ll fix it too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“There are promising reforms being developed in Congress that should receive bi-partisan support.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it! Hard to argue with a guy like Trump who understands the issues on this deep of a level and who presents such a highly detailed plan, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, if one were inclined to argue with a genius like Trump, and one were interested in &lt;i&gt;actual solutions&lt;/i&gt; to America’s public health crisis in mental health, one might find it worthwhile to engage with Hillary Clinton’s “Comprehensive Agenda on Mental Health.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;H.R.C. and her campaign put together a plan that not only names the real challenges faced by families struggling with mental health issues, but that also includes policy proposals that could be implemented immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It addresses: the need for early diagnosis of mental disorders, the growing rate of suicide in America, Mental Health and the prison system, addiction, access to care and integration of Mental Health and traditional medical care, and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with just a quick scan, it’s clear that there’s no passing the buck in Hillary’s platform. No dancing around the issues or vague, meaningless, statements. She’s an experienced and perceptive leader, an American, and a human being who understands the immediacy with which our country needs to elevate issues in mental health to the forefront of our policy discussion about healthcare.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you know anyone who’s struggled with depression, anxiety, suicide, addiction, or any mental health problem, you can support them while simultaneously rejecting utter ignorance by casting your vote for Hillary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She gets it, and he doesn’t. I’m with her, and so is my field.&lt;/p&gt;

She is 21 and for the past two or three years has been battling a wicked form of cancer that has puzzled oncologists near and far. She is one of the most pure people that anyone has ever met, always with a kind word for others, and a generosity of spirit that you come across only a few times in life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a tough time for anyone who knows her. This isn’t the way things are supposed to happen. But right now, the question I ask right now isn’t “why.” As a matter of fact, and this is odd for a therapist to admit, I’m not finding questions to ask at all right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the reason for my lack of questions goes something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that there are powers and forces that exist beyond our ability to comprehend. I believe that God is bigger, more expansive, more powerful than any of us have the capacity to conceptualize. And I believe that this has to be the case, not for the observable reasons or miracles I can point to, but instead because of the times when I can’t point to a single one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Allow me to walk you through my logic, or perhaps my lack thereof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ll begin with the exposition of applicable laws and assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with an oldie, but goodie. Newton’s third law of motion (yeah, I checked to ensure I had the number right) states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. For every force exerted, a force of equal magnitude is exerted right back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re off to a great start. Let’s stick with the physics track for another one. We’ll call the universe a closed system for our own purposes here and note that within closed systems, energy, like matter, can neither be destroyed nor created. Instead it is conserved and simply changes into different forms. Swell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Third, I believe that spirit is energy that we all possess. However you want to define it, positive energy, good juju, whatever, spirit is a force, and we carry it within us. Some folks do a better job of letting it shine than others, but we all have it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, energy x time = power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I rid myself of questions by applying this to the impending death of our friend. Here’s how.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believe that with her death, her spirit, and energy, and all of her power will be conserved and renewed. I know this. All of the energy that would have been generated over the long life she should have had (were an entirely rational force or being placed in charge of the universe) will not simply disappear. Her soul is too large, and her compassion too great to simply vanish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Her power will be converted and stored, unleashed through everyone who was lucky enough to be a witness to her strength. The repercussions of her life and the spirits that she touched will be so great and so vast that no one person will be able to grasp them. Oh, we’ll try to. We’re hardwired to try to make sense of senseless things. The usual questions of “why” will fight their way back, time and again. But I believe that the entropy, the drive to disorder that the explosion of the star within this young woman’s heart is going to create, I believe it’s part of a bigger plan. One that we cannot see, and weren’t meant to. We’ll see bits and pieces, sure. The apple hit Newton, didn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the months to come, there will be more events held and money raised. There will be lives changed and people touched. But the big picture, the true meaning, it won’t present itself in full to us. It’s the plan of a God bigger than anything than we were built to imagine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m going to believe in that. I’m going to zoom out as far as I can, and when my brain hurts and my heart throbs for answers, I’m going to breathe deeply and recognize that God’s beyond what we were meant to know. And that’s alright.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>&quot;. . . God is bigger, more expansive, more powerful than any of us have the capacity to conceptualize. And I believe that this has to be the case, not for the observable reasons or miracles I can point to, but instead because of the times when I can’t point to a single one.&quot;</summary></entry><entry><title>On My Existential Honeymoon</title><link href="/b-On_My_Existential_Honeymoon/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="On My Existential Honeymoon" /><published>2016-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/b-On_My_Existential_Honeymoon</id><content type="html" xml:base="/b-On_My_Existential_Honeymoon/">&lt;blockquote&gt;“Suddenly there was a silence and into the night a violin sang a desperately sad tango, an unusual tune not spoiled by frequent playing. The violin wept and a part of me wept with it, for on that same day someone had a twenty-fourth birthday. That someone lay in another part of the Auschwitz camp, possibly only a few hundred or a thousand yards away, and yet completely out of reach. That someone was my wife.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Floored, I fought the suspended reality created by the roar of the airplane as I set my book down and glanced over at my own twenty-four year old wife. She woke from her doze and smiled back at me, oblivious to the radical juxtaposition that had just smacked me upside the head. There was simply no way for her to know, and no way for me to convey the gratitude I felt to God for her at that moment. I let it be, and she drifted back to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two of us were not yet 48 hours married and jetting off to honeymoon for a week at a tropical resort. I had begun to delve into Viktor Frankl’s hallmark book, Man’s Search for Meaning, the first half of which is a gripping and detailed account of the horrors that he suffered as a prisoner during the Holocaust. Imprisoned for over three years at four different concentration camps, Frankl experienced inconceivable trials at the hands of the Nazis. Starvation. Torturous slave labor. Disease. Frankl narrowly escaped death, but his liberation was met with the discovery that his mother, father, and his young wife had not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of my honeymoon, my mind became filled of the differences between Frankl’s experiences and my own. Where Frankl had no agency over his circumstances, I had full control over mine. I had access to endless food and drink where he had only the occasional scrap of bread and unclean water. He had no idea of the whereabouts or safety of his wife with no means for finding out; mine was by my side 24/7 as we relished in absolute paradise together. The list expanded endlessly and it was more than obvious that my honeymooning experiences and Frankl’s imprisonment represented polar opposite experiences on the human spectrum of pleasure and suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the Holocaust, Frankl returned to the nothingness that awaited him in Vienna. There, he reflected on his experiences and derived universal existential themes of human spirituality and psychology from the suffering he had both experienced and witnessed. Out of his experiences, he found the philosophical evidence for the creation of Logotherapy, basing it upon the idea that man is driven not entirely by biopsychosocial drives or desire for power, but that a quest for a meaning and purpose is man’s primary motivating force.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As evidence for Logotherapy, Frankl found both extremes of human spirit and perseverance in the face of unthinkable challenges. Frankl cited story after story of prisoners losing faith in the future and succumbing almost immediately to the abhorrent psychological and physiological pressures of the concentration camps. Those who were able to maintain a sense of purpose however, often fared much better against these conditions, informing his conclusion that these forces of meaning are more powerful and intrinsic than our biological drives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Frankl’s experiences in the concentration camps poked a major hole in Freud’s assertion that any group of men, experiencing severe threats to his survival would be devoid of all individual differences and that, “in their stead will appear the uniform expression of the one unstilled urge.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To this claim, Frankl rebuked,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Thank heaven, Sigmund Freud was spared knowing the concentration camps from the inside. His subjects lay on a couch designed in the plush style of Victorian culture, not in the filth of Auschwitz. There, the “individual differences” did not “blur” but, on the contrary, people became more different; people unmasked themselves, both the swine and the saints.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankl experienced first-hand the sort of differences that remained evident in men, even as they were systematically stripped of all worldly necessities. He tells of some prisoners who were promoted to capos and placed in charge of other prisoners. Some capos abused their power and treated prisoners worse than members of the S.S. had. But even amidst this suffering and threat to survival, others seized opportunities and used them to look out for his fellow man. Frankl memorably tells of the sole prisoner he encountered who ladled out soup to each individual impartially, giving equal amounts of beans and hearty ingredients to each individual in the line, regardless of nationality or background. According to Frankl, these differences, manifesting even in the face of unbelievable biological pressures, proved that man’s soul consisted of more than animal instincts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Processing these truths, I basked in surreality and hid from the tropical sun as we spent our vacation eating and lounging. Every biological need met. In the complete absence of any psychological stressors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How can I wrap my mind around this scale of human suffering and magnitude of Frankl’s resulting wisdom when I only suffer from an inevitable mild sunburn?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;How do I make sense of these truths of human spirituality and the search for meaning at the core of our being when the only decision I need to make is what sort of food I want for dinner?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mulled over these questions throughout the week, I saw that even in these conditions of luxury, vacationers facing the slightest of challenges still found room for complaint. Folks complained about food, heat, shower door hinges, beach conditions, service, you-name-it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frankl, in speaking to challenges of a far more extreme sort said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“. . . in the bitter fight for self-preservation he (man) may forget his human dignity and become no more than an animal. Here lies the chance for a man either to make use of or to forgo the opportunities of attaining the moral values that a difficult situation may afford him. And this decides whether he is worthy of his sufferings or not.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can only assume that these individuals who could not find contentedness, even in the absence of any apparent physiological and psychological stressors, surely must have been suffering from issues of existence and meaning. At the very least, these guests blew off the opportunity to practice humility and grace in the face of incredibly trivial disappointments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth that I found that week within Logotherapy is that both in the presence and absence of stressors, man acts in accordance with the state of his soul. Frankl said that it is the healing of this soul that is the mission of psychiatry and I hope to continue in this tradition through the therapy I provide. Most of all, I pray that I make the most of the underlying opportunities within challenges that come to face me in my own life.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary>&quot;. . . my mind became filled of the differences between Frankl’s experiences and my own. Where Frankl had no agency over his circumstances, I had full control over mine. I had access to endless food and drink where he had only the occasional scrap of bread and unclean water.&quot;</summary></entry><entry><title>Who’s Holbemn?</title><link href="/Who's_Holbemn/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Who's Holbemn?" /><published>2016-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2016-10-19T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/Who's_Holbemn</id><content type="html" xml:base="/Who's_Holbemn/">&lt;p&gt;Welcome to Holbemn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad you’re here. If you’re anything like me, you find that the world of mental health with its various overlapping disciplines and theories can be mysterious and frankly, highly confusing. As a graduate student in Clinical Mental Health Counseling, I often find myself asking questions like, “How is psychoanalysis different than psychotherapy,” and more confounding, human questions such as “Why do I continue to act in ways that I know are bad for me,” and, “How can I find my purpose in life?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some of these questions, there are no clear answers. But rather than turn away from the inherent muddiness of these age-old conundrums, here at Holbemn, we’re going to lean in and face them head-on. Check back here often for explorations of ideas both big and small in mental health as I progress through my training to become a therapist. I’ll be sharing weekly dispatches from therapy school on what our training is like, what it takes to be a counselor (emotionally, personally, &amp;amp; spiritually), and what the process of therapy is like as a therapist. Other times, I will share my favorite mental health resources, news articles, and on occasion, commentary/criticism of how issues in mental health are portrayed by the media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Helping people achieve their potential through therapy is my main passion, but I also spend my time playing video games, making and consuming music, listening to podcasts, reading, and writing. I am blessed to find myself newly married to my best friend. That this is a terrible cliché, I am well-aware, but it’s the truest way I know to describe her. Together, we’re navigating the ups and downs of becoming our own family unit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am also a progressive Christian, purposefully embroiled in the process of discovering what this means for me as a counselor and a human being. Above all else, I believe that my faith calls me to recognize that simply by being here in the world, every person has infinite worth, and as such, an equally immense responsibility to love and affirm one another. I hope that my actions and writings reflect this attitude of love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is my responsibility that I must also offer a disclaimer that I will in no way, shape, or form provide clinical or professional opinions here at Holbemn. There are a number of reasons for this, first of which being that I am writing here under a pseudonym (for the creative license it grants me), and also that internet interactions are simply not conducive to achieving meaningful assessment or therapy. Additionally, I am not yet licensed, and want to make this absolutely clear. All of this is to say that I would ask you to please consume my writings knowing that they are the personal opinions of someone who simply cares greatly for you and your circumstances, but is in no position to dole out clinical advice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do happen to find yourself in the midst of a dark time due to struggles with substance abuse, interpersonal problems, depression, anxiety, or even if you simply need someone to talk to, I highly recommend that you seek out a counselor. We all have areas of our lives that we can improve, and I’ve found that obtaining impartial third party opinions through counseling is one of the most powerful tools out there for helping us to make those positive changes. Visit my &lt;a href=&quot;/resources&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; resource page&lt;/a&gt; to browse online resources as well as databases of counselors in order to find one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please stick around if you are intrigued by anything you’ve read here at Holbemn! There will be new writings here each week, concerning any number of topics in mental health. Also, be sure to add your email to the subscription box if you like what you’ve read and want new dispatches delivered to your inbox (no more than two per week, I promise!) Please reach out to me if you have any comments, constructive criticism, or something interesting to share. You can reach me at holbemn(at)holbemn.xyz. Come back soon, and until then, have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
