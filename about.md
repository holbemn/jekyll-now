Holbemn is a therapist-in-training, thoroughly rooted in the Midwest. He writes weekly about his personal experiences in therapy, thoughts on mental health, and bizarre questions about life and living.

Please send your own bizarre questions, comments, or thoughts to me at holbemn(at)holbemn.xyz or on Twitter, <a href="https://twitter.com/Holbemn" target="Holbemn Twitter">@Holbemn</a>. I must disclaim that I cannot dispense any clinical advice and that my writing here is reflective solely of my personal opinions and thoughts.
